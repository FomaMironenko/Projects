Moore received a scholarship to pursue studies at the Royal College of Art in London. While there he spent ample time at the British Museum studying their ethnographic collections, which strongly informed his later monumental figurative works.  He lived in Paris, enrolling in classes that periodically met at the Louvre, and encountered an Aztec sculpture at the Musée d'Ethnographie that would be a crucial influence on his early work.  This sculpture encouraged his inclination to create direct carved, single figures focused on their mass and form. He made his first prints in 1931 and altogether made something over 700 prints during his career.  From the late 1960s printmaking became an increasingly important part of Moore’s artistic output and as with his sculpture and drawings two abiding themes were reclining female forms and mother and child. Moore’s artwork has been exhibited extensively at notable venues such as the Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Royal Academy of Arts, London, Shanghai Art Museum, National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, Tate Britain, London, Kremlin Museum, Moscow and many other institutions around the world.Artist’s alternative names: Henry Spencer Moore, Moore.\n""]"

The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York recently contributed to the argument for this point of view with their 2012 exhibition Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years, which juxtaposed Warhol’s work with work by artists from Cindy Sherman to Christopher Wool that have followed in his footsteps in style or method. In the early 60s Warhol helped usher in an era of Pop art using culturally iconic images in his work from the popular media, like Campbell’s soup cans and celebrity figures including Marilyn, Elvis and Jackie O. But his élan for experimentation and innovation did not end there. He problematized authorship making unique works from silkscreens in series, and called his studio The Factory where he allowed assistants to make art in his stead. His practice was truly multimedia before anyone really took anything but his paintings seriously. As early as 1963 he began making films, and from 1965-67 he managed the band The Velvet Underground. In 1968 he announced an end to his painting career and founded Interview Magazine instead. He of course did return to painting in 1972 with his famous Mao series and continued to introduce new ideas with bodies of work as diverse as the abstract leaning Shadow paintings and the last series he completed before his death based on Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper.\r\n                            ']"

Modigliani moved to Paris and was exposed to a new artistic lifestyle upon his arrival. He became very involved in the bohemian, dramatic and romantic surroundings of the city. As a result of his inspired environment Modigliani discovered his passion among figurative paintings more specifically, nudes.
